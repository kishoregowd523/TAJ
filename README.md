The Taj Mahal is considered to be the greatest architectural achievement in the whole range of Indo-Islamic architecture. Its recognised architectonic beauty has a rhythmic combination of solids and voids, concave and convex and light shadow; such as arches and domes further increases the aesthetic aspect. Not a piece of architecture, as other buildings are, but the proud passions of an emperorâ€™s love wrought in living stones.
